#  LLM-from-Scratch

A simple and extensible transformer-based Language Model built entirely from scratch in PyTorch, trained on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. This project is part of my ongoing exploration into the inner workings of LLMs, with a strong focus on optimization.

##  Project Overview

This repository is a minimal yet complete implementation of a transformer model, covering all the core components of modern LLMs:

- Tokenization (character-level)
- Positional Encoding
- Multi-head Self-Attention
- Transformer Blocks
- Causal Masking
- Training loop with CrossEntropy loss
- Sampling & interactive generation

The goal is not just to train a small LLM, but to understand *how* each building block contributes to the model‚Äôs performance, generalization, and learning stability ‚Äî essential for trustworthy and secure model design.

## Academic Context

This project ties directly into my academic focus: building secure, explainable, and efficient AI models. It complements my broader research interests in:

- Model robustness and interpretability
- Secure machine learning and data privacy
- Low-level system understanding of ML architectures
- Exploring how LLMs can be optimized for constrained environments
-
